  <h1>IVETA CHADIMOVA</h1>
  <h2>STATEMENT</h2>
  <p class="statement">UX writer and multilingual localization specialist with a background in technical translation (EN/DE/CZ), a love for clear instructions, and a strong interest in AI, digital products, and web development.
    <br><br>
    After years translating complex technical documentation—especially in the automotive industry—I shifted into UX and product writing. I’ve worked on onboarding flows, in-app copy, and chatbot scripts, with a passion for making digital experiences intuitive, inclusive, and human-centered.
    <br><br>
    I recently upskilled through a software engineering bootcamp, where I deepened my technical foundation and learned to write code. Today, I also build websites as a web developer—from custom WordPress builds to hand-coded projects—and continue expanding my tech toolkit with tools like Figma, AI prompt design, and localization platforms.
    <br><br>
    I bring cross-cultural fluency, technical accuracy, and UX best practices into every word I write—and every product I help create.
    <br><br>
    Currently open to:
    <br><br>
    UX writing (apps, SaaS, chatbots, mobile flows)
    <br>
    AI content QA or prompt evaluation
    <br>
    Multilingual localization & AI translation review (EN/DE/CZ)
    <br>
    UX-focused web development and content design projects
    <br></p>
