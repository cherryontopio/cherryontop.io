            <p>Changing careers is never easy, and when you're stepping into the world of tech, it's common to feel like you're faking it. That voice in your head whispering, "You don't belong here," is imposter syndrome—and it's more common than you think.</p>

            <h3>What Is Imposter Syndrome?</h3>
            <p>Imposter syndrome is the persistent belief that you're not as competent as others perceive you to be, despite evidence of your achievements. It shows up as self-doubt, fear of being exposed as a fraud, or attributing your success to luck rather than skill.</p>
            <p>This can be especially potent when transitioning into a new field like tech, where you're surrounded by people who seem to "speak another language"—literally and figuratively. Whether you’re learning to code, diving into UX design, or managing digital products, it’s easy to feel out of place among peers who seem more experienced or confident.</p>

            <h3>Why It Hits Career Changers Hard</h3>
            <p>When you pivot into tech from a different background—say, teaching, hospitality, retail, or the arts—your brain tends to compare your “beginner” status in tech with someone else’s years of experience. It’s a mental mismatch that fuels the narrative that you’re behind, unqualified, or somehow sneaking your way into rooms you don’t deserve to be in.</p>

            <h3>Here’s the truth: you are not a fraud. You are a beginner.</h3>
            <p>And beginners are allowed to ask questions, to make mistakes, and to grow. In fact, your unique background brings a valuable perspective that purely technical resumes often lack. Diverse teams build better products, and your journey into tech makes you part of that much-needed diversity.</p>

            <h3>How to Manage Imposter Syndrome</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1. Normalize the Feeling</strong><br>
                Nearly everyone in tech has felt imposter syndrome—even seasoned developers and CTOs. Knowing you're not alone can help you stop over-identifying with the feeling.</li>

              <li><strong>2. Keep a "Wins" Journal</strong><br>
                Document your progress: small coding breakthroughs, user feedback, or a kind word from a mentor. These serve as tangible reminders of your growth and capability.</li>

              <li><strong>3. Focus on Learning, Not Proving</strong><br>
                You’re not in tech to prove your worth to everyone; you’re here to learn and build. Reframing your mindset around growth can reduce performance anxiety and help you stay curious.</li>

              <li><strong>4. Join Communities</strong><br>
                Engage with beginner-friendly groups like #100DaysOfCode, Women Who Code, or local meetups. Community support can be a powerful antidote to self-doubt.</li>

              <li><strong>5. Rewire Your Self-Talk</strong><br>
                Pay attention to your inner dialogue. Replace “I don’t know what I’m doing” with “I’m learning something new.” It’s a subtle but transformative shift.</li>

              <li><strong>6. Seek Mentors, Not Idols</strong><br>
                Find people a few steps ahead of you who remember what starting out felt like. Mentors who are honest about their own challenges can help normalize your experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Remember: Confidence Follows Action</h3>
            <p>You don’t wait to feel confident before taking action—you build confidence by showing up, trying, and growing through the process. Every job application you send, every bug you fix, every concept you finally understand chips away at that voice of doubt.</p>

            <p>So the next time imposter syndrome shows up, take it as a sign you’re doing something brave. Because you are.</p>

            <p>Your seat at the table isn't a favor. You earned it—by being curious, courageous, and committed. Tech needs people like you. Keep going.</p>
