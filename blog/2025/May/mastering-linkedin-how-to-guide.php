<p>To truly stand out on LinkedIn, consistency and content quality are key. Here’s how to plan your posts for maximum impact:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Post Frequency:</strong> Aim to publish 3 to 5 times per week to stay visible without overwhelming your network.</li>
  <li><strong>Best Days:</strong> Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday tend to see the highest engagement rates.</li>
  <li><strong>Best Times:</strong> Early mornings (8–10 AM local time) work best as professionals are starting their day.</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement Strategy:</strong> Spend 15–30 minutes engaging with other people’s content before posting your own—it boosts visibility and builds community.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pro tip:</em> Avoid posting on weekends unless your content is highly engaging or aimed at a global audience in different time zones.</p>

<h3>Engagement-Boosting Tips</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ask thoughtful questions at the end of your post to invite conversation and comments.</li>
  <li>Tag relevant people or companies strategically to expand your post’s reach (but avoid over-tagging).</li>
  <li>Use 3–5 targeted hashtags that are relevant to your industry, niche, or the topic at hand.</li>
  <li>Always respond to comments within 24 hours to nurture relationships and boost algorithmic visibility.</li>
  <li>Re-share high-performing posts after 60–90 days with new insights or a fresh introduction to reach a new audience.</li>
</ol>
